README FILE: INSTRUCTIONS FOR INSTALLING GNU MCSIM
Contact: Frederic Yves BOIS

The simplest way to compile the MCSim package is:

  1. `cd' to the directory containing the package's source code (it is
     actually the directory where this README file resides) and type
     `./configure' to configure the package for your system.  If you're
     using `csh' on an old version of System V, you might need to type
     `sh ./configure' instead to prevent `csh' from trying to execute
     `configure' itself.

     Running `configure' may take a while. While running, it prints some
     messages telling which features it is checking for.

  2. Type `make' to compile the package.

  3. Optionally, type `make check' to run any self-tests that come with
     the package. In some systems the Makefile that runs the tests in
     the example/perc/ folder needs to be flagged as executable explictly
     before running the test, otherwise the test fails. To make it executable
     simply execute "chmod a+x examples/perc/Makefile" from the command line.

  4. Type `make install' to install the programs and any data files and
     documentation.

  5. You can remove the program binaries and object files from the
     source code directory by typing `make real-clean'. To also remove the
     files that `configure' created (so you can compile the package for
     a different kind of computer), type `make dist-clean'. There is
     also a `make maintainer-clean' target which undoes the installation.

For detailed installation instructions see the INSTALL file.
