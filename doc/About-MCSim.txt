MCSim is a simulation package which allows you to design your own
model (eventually dynamic, via ODEs) and to perform sensitivity and
uncertainty analyses through Monte Carlo stochastic simulations, or 
Bayesian inference or optimal design through Markov Chain Monte 
Carlo simulations. MCSim can read models written in SBML.

MCSim is GNU software. You can redistribute it and/or modify it under
the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by the Free
Software Foundation; either version 3 of the License, or (at your
option) any later version.

The latest version (5.6.6) of the package, written in C, is available
in original source code. You should be able to compile it on any
machine of your choice. You will need a C compiler. For Unix machines
we recommend GNU's gcc, although other compilers (e.g. c89) might
work. MCSim uses some routines from the GNU Scientific Library (GSL),
and libSBML. We recommend that you install those (free) libraries on
your system. Otherwise, the program should run but some of its
functionalities will be disabled.

The package is distributed as a compressed tar archive which
contains:

  A User's Manual (under texinfo)
  The source code Mod program to preprocess your models
  The source code for the MCSim routines to link to your models
  The source code for xmcsim, a simple MCSim GUI
  Examples of model and simulation files

You should read the User's Manual before attempting to use the
software. Check also the Manual-Update.txt file for last minute
updates and tips. Finally, the README and INSTALL files describe
instalation procedures.
