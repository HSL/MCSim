Introduction
------------

This interface to gnuplot was developed on the basis of Xgnuplot using
Tcl and Tk. It provides a convenient means to set gnuplot options 
using a point and click approach. Since the application is written 
entirely in the scripting language Tcl using the Tk toolkit, it is 
extensible and users can easily add additional functionality.

It should be possible for anyone with a passing knowledge of gnuplot 
to use this interface.


Plotting a data file
--------------------

To plot a data file simply enter the file name in the first entry 
field or search your file with the button "Browse". The format of 
the file must conform to that specified normally for gnuplot 
(click on further information for more details). You may select 
the columns of the file to plot by entering appropriate numbers or 
the variable names in the columns fields. You can select the columns
by the variable names with the buttons Browse. You have to click on 
the buttons OK in order to update the numbers of the columns and the 
variable names. When the file and the columns are selected, click on 
"Plot" in the main command bar; the graphic will be displayed in a 
gnuplot X11 window. By default the key will be set to the text 
representing the plotted file, you can override this by entering text 
in the entry field to the right of the "Title:" check button, for
example enter the text "First line" and click on plot again --
your function will be re-displayed with a different entry in the
key.

To replot you should click on the "Overlay" check button in the
right of the window and then on "Plot" in the main command bar.

If the data file is a function of two coordinates, you should select 
a 3D plot by clicking on the Radio button in the bottom of the window 
to select a 3D plot option.

Line and symbol styles used to display the data are selected from 
the "Style:" "Line:" and "Point:" menus n the third row of the line 
entry panel.


Options
-------

A full range of options may be specified for the plots. The options 
appropriate to each line are set in the line panels themselves 
(i.e. type line-style, columns to plot, overlay, etc.). Options for 
the complete plot can be set by selecting an appropriate entry from 
the Options menu. In each case a new window will appear in which 
options can be set :

 Main...       Titles, axes and data range, data sampling etc.
 3D...         3D plot options, orientation, style, contour options...
 Polar...      Options for polar plots
 Command Line  Options for entering your own command line in gnuplot

For more details on exactly what the options mean consult the gnuplot 
manual for details of the options that you may which to set and then 
select these from the appropriate menus. Alternatively just give it 
a try and see what happens.
